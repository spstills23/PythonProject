Python/SQL Class Project 
		- Sean Stills

-For this project I asked the question of:
	"Does a college basketball team perform better when their mascot is Human or Non-Human in the NCAA basketball Tournament?"

-This report will take the results from every NCAA Tournamnet game since the 1985 season and compare whether teams with Non-Human or Human mascots win more.

-I first came across the data I needed on Kaggle. The link to the original is located here https://www.kaggle.com/ncaa/ncaa-basketball. 
This provided me with all the data that I needed from 1985 on. 
There is really no background to this question that I am trying to answer other than the simple fact that I am curious of what the outome would be but I have a general hypothesis of what the end results will show.
Within the report I will build dataframes and SQL databases to map out and show Team Total Wins,Team Wins merged with Mascots Names and finally catagorizing them into human and non-humans.
We will count data sets to tally totals, graph with bar graphs and histograms as well as use some statistics and pie charts to see the results of our above questions.

-There should be no neeed for special directions in running the code in jupyter notebooks. All files and information should be apart of the project folder.
